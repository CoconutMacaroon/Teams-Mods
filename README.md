# A guide to modifing Microsoft Teams (with JavaScript)

First, a little background on what this is. It is a guide to what I have figured out in Microsoft Teams. I wanted to be able to add features that I could not do normally. I was able to open the developer tools, but I was unable to find any useful reference on the internal HTML or how it works. In the Wiki, I attempt to document everything I have figured out how to do _only using the JavaScript console in the DevTools_. This is _not_ a reference guide or documentation, but it does contain what I have figured out how to do. This repo is meant as a cookbook, of (hopefully) useful things you can do. All of these experiments assume you are in the JavaScript console within DevTools. So read Opening DevTools before you try these.

## Hey! Where are the tutorials?

In the Wiki.
